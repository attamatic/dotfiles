# Which one to use?

## Hinted

Hinted font is used for low resolution screen to have better render effect. From my experience, if your screen resolution is lower or equal than 1080P, it is recommended to use "hinted font". Using "unhinted font" will lead to misalignment or uneven thickness on your text.

In this case, you can choose MapleMono-TTF-AutoHint / MapleMono-NF / MapleMono-NF-CN, etc.


## Unhinted

Unhinted font is used for high resolution screen (e.g. for MacBook). Using "hinted font" will blur your text or make it looks weird.

In this case, you can choose MapleMono-OTF / MapleMono-TTF / MapleMono-NF-unhinted / MapleMono-NF-CN-unhinted, etc.
